import { Canvas, Meta, Story } from '@storybook/addon-docs';

  component={Archived}

export const ArchivedTemplate = (args) => {
  return <Archived {...args}></Archived>;
};

# Archived

## Language

using the `french` prop it is possible to set the language of the Archived to french

## Optional link

using the `content` prop it is possible to add a link to a replacement page (if one exists) and explain why the current page was archived

## Example to fiddle with

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default" args={{ french: true, content: 'This is the content' }}>
    {ArchivedTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
