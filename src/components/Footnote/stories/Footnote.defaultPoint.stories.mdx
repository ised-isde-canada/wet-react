# Footnote

## Default Point

A workaround was implemented to ensure the footer items always refer to the first instance where the footnote is refered in the content.

It is a best practice that the footers are property coded where their reference is pointing initially to the first instance.

When this is not the case, it will show a warning like: `wb-fnote - Relink first reference of #myfoootnote for #fn4-1-rf`.

This best practice can be disabled by setting the `disableDefaultPoint` attribute of a given `Footnote` to true.

## Example

<Canvas>
  <span>
    <aside class="wb-fnote" role="note">
      <h2 id="fn">Footnotes</h2>
      <dl>
        <FootnoteSection.Footnote
          children="This is a foot"
          value="1"
          disableDefaultPoint
        />
      </dl>
    </aside>
  </span>
</Canvas>

note: by including `disableDefaultPoint` in the arguments, the attribute is automatically
set to true
