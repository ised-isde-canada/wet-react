# MathML

MathML enables the display of mathematical formulas. Because some browsers do not support this functionality natively, this polyfill emulates the same functionality using MathJax

## Known Issues

<ul>
  <li>
    Browsers that lack both MathML and SVG support (e.g., IE8 - IE9) will take
    longer to load MathML than browsers with either SVG or MathML support
  </li>
  <li>
    IE8 takes a lot longer to load MathML than IE9 (known MathJax reflow issue)
  </li>
  <li>
    Pages with a lot of complex formulas can take a few minutes to load on slow
    machines running IE8 (known MathJax issue)
  </li>
</ul>

## How To Use

To use the polyfill, standard MathML is required. In cases where a browser doesn't support MathML, the polyfill is automatically loaded
