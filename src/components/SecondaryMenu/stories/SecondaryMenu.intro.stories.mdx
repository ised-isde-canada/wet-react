# SecondaryMenu

Provides an interactive secondary menu

## Recommended Use

The secondary menu should only be used on pages below Canada.ca’s global themes/topics layer.
Topic pages are part of the wayfinding/themes/topics space and do not permit the use of local navigation menus.

Site destination/task sections which would benefit from allowing users to move laterally can make use of a local menu to facilitate
navigation between the destinations contained within the last/lowest subtopic in the Canada.ca theme/topic hierarchy.

The section menu should always display the destinations/tasks from the lowest-level subtopic above the user’s location,
and should not change as the user moves deeper into destination/task content.

Additionally, when a section menu is employed, it should be present on all pages belonging to that lowest-level subtopic.
So, the section menu should not disappear after a user selects an item from the menu.

The first item in the menu is a non-clickable header, reflecting the title of the last/lowest subtopic.
The clickable items in the menu are the sibling destinations/pages listed on that lowest subtopic page.

The section menu should only go one level deep. It should not attempt to display links to sub-pages below the current page.
Instead, all navigation within/below the current page should be handled using elements in the content area.

(Related note: the “related information” block should not be used for navigation. Instead, all links in a page’s content area
(including related info links) should be contextual; limited to information that is directly related to the current page.

## Example

<Canvas>
  <SecondaryMenu title="Content Page - Secondary Menu">
    <SecondaryMenu.Item title="Item 1" />
    <SecondaryMenu.Item title="Item 2" link="#two" />
    <SecondaryMenu.Item title="Item 3" />
    <SecondaryMenu.Item title="Item 4" />
    <SecondaryMenu.Item title="Item 5" />
  </SecondaryMenu>
</Canvas>
