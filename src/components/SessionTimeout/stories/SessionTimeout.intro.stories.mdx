# SessionTimeout

Create a session inactivity timeout that warns users when their session is about to expire.

When a user requests a page with this plugin implemented their session will begin. After the specified session period,
they will be notified that their session is about to timeout. At this point, they will have the option to remain logged in by clicking
"Continue session", or signing out by clicking "End session now".

At any time during the session, if the user remains idle for a specified amount of time, they will be notified that their session is
about to timeout. If the user does not respond to the timeout notification within a specified amount of time, or if they click
"End session now" they will be automatically redirected to the sign out page.

Note that once the session is timed out the user **will** be redirected to the logoutURL. No popup will appear telling the user what happened,
as that would require leaving the user on the current page, at which point they could simply delete the popup to regain access.
It is recommended that you redirect the user to a page which can tell them that their session timed out, and offer a link to the login page.

## Example

<Canvas>
  <span>
    <p>
      The SessionTimeout in this example has default parameters, so it will take
      a while to activate.
