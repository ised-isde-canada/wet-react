# SessionTimeout

## LogoutURL

Use the `logoutURL` attribute to redirect the user to another page when their session times out. It is important to set this value,
as the default is the empty string, e.g. the current page reloaded.

Note that once the session is timed out the user **will** be redirected to the logoutURL. No popup will appear telling the user what happened,
as that would require leaving the user on the current page, at which point they could simply delete the popup to regain access.
It is recommended that you redirect the user to a page which can tell them that their session timed out, and offer a link to the login page.

## Example

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="LogoutURL"
    args={{ sessionTime: 10, logoutURL: 'https://google.com' }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
